### Hi there, I'm Subhash 👋

- 👀 I’m interested in backend development, data engineering, and exploring DevOps and AI.

- 💻 Working on projects like a **restaurant review and recommendation system** and a **role-based authentication system**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to backend development, especially those involving Spring Boot, microservices, or real-time applications.
